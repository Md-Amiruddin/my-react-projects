Used AppWrite to store files and database.

## Goals

The objective was to learn how to incorporate CRUD to/from server in React apps. I have used AppWrite for database, storing files and authentication.

## Features

<ul>
<li>Uses Appwrite authentication service to authenticate and keep track of users.</li>
<li>Appwrite db keeps track of the posts on the platform.</li>

</ul>

## Learnings

<ul>
  <li>Writing production grade react components and adaptive code to prevent vendor lock-in.</li>
  <li>Used react router to define routes as well as manage them</li>
  <li>Used redux-toolkit to manage states like login, userdata etc. - Configuring stores, defining reducers etc. </li>
  <li>Handling asynchronous tasks seamlessly like login, file upload etc.</li>
  <li>Learned to build a modular app, manage the separate components and bring them together cohesively.</li>
  <li>Writing conditional code</li>
  <li>Learned to use React Hook forms</li>
</ul>
